# Solarized Themes for Fargo Outliner

Attached are two CSS files that can be used to emulate emacs' org mode when using the [solarized theme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).

I've included the indent level colorizations in each file, but you can delete that part if you prefer a more monotone outline theme.

The steps to use are as follows:

1. Download/Open the css file of your chosen theme.
2. Copy and paste into the CSS portion of the Fargo settings.
3. Delete the indent-level color styling if you want.

## Issues that might be fixed one day
1. Icons are currently not colored, only the text is
2. The included colorizations only go 15 levels of indentation deep.
3. When not using the colored lines, highlighting a headline in structure mode turns the text white.
