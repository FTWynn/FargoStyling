# Themes for Fargo Outliner

These are CSS files that can be used to style Dave Winer's outliner, [Fargo](http://fargo.io).

The inital inspiration came from reproducing emacs' org mode when using the [solarized theme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). Others may follow

I've included comments in each file that will hopefully help anyone who wants to tweak them. For example, if you don't like the colors in the Solarized themes, just delete everything after the /* Colorized */ comment.

The steps to use are as follows:

1. Download/Open the css file of your chosen theme.
2. Copy and paste into the CSS portion of the Fargo settings.
3. Delete/change any particulars as preferred.
